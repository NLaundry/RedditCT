Your clothes come out just as soft and there’s less lint in the trap. Towels are interesting because they’re nearly as soft but I feel they’re more effective because there isn’t fabric softener on the surface.

Edit: just wanted to add, that crud is sitting above your fabric softener cup. So it’s not that your system is moldy, it’s that your washer is spraying Jets into the fabric softener and it’s splashing back. Then it builds up and molds.

5. Break out and remove base - be careful to save the conduit going through the base. Also tape it up so dirt doesn't get into the duct.
6. Dig hole for new base - make sure to compact the bottom, ideally you are placing some gravel on the bottom and then tamping it.
7. Place new base, make sure it's plumb by checking with a level. If it's not level, shove some dirt/gravel underneath the low corner until it is! You want to get a pretty skookum base, that little pad you have does not look like it could even hold your pole let alone getting hit. Get a trapezoid one that could be sunken in 3-4 feet.
8. Connect the conduit you saved onto base, if you saved enough slack wire you can pull the wire thru to the top of the base before you connect on the conduit
9. Backfill your hole. Ideally you place gravel in 1ft layers and then tamp the shit out of it between each layer. Place top soil at the top of your backfill
10. Dowel in bolts if your base doesn't not have any - make sure it lines up with your new light
11. Grab a buddy: set light onto base and bolt (pray you compacted it properly and it doesn't flop over)

13. Pull/splice wires (might need to do this before you set the light depending on if you have a hand hole on your new light)

Playing music traveling the globe, heavily this year, the most I’ve ever done since I’ve started, which should feel rewarding. I feel incredibly lost and have lost so much along the way that I think I’ve chased something for so long that might ultimately ruin my life.

Family estranged for what little there was when I was young. No connection at home now, which is why I chased this “career”. By some miracle I turned a hobby into a machine that has consumed and turned me into someone I don’t recognize. I can’t meet people, I make hollow friendships, have no one to talk to or let things out to and every single relationship I’ve worked on falls apart due to being gone so often. 

I’m becoming a drunk that has absolutely become an addiction, I feel like a loser, and just am pissing my life away on a dream that isn’t what I thought it was. 

Going home and stopping seems worse than quitting this all together. Depression is fucking vicious and cruel. I’ve been in this spot since touring/performing ending in 2020. Now I’ve been busier than ever, but more disgusted and upset with where I am in life.

I am happy to read no sign of addiction in your post. Alcohol is a fucking poison.

About your social vibe, don't force yourself to be with others if you don't want....choose who you hang out with and when you do it...social skills aren't gifted to everyone and some people find it hard to interact with others (especially if you have other disorder like borderline personality disorder)

Until you get help, dress a list of things you like, which can litterally be anything from skydiving to watch a sunset or get a coffee from the store...if you have a hard time finding what gives you a little bit of happiness, dress a second list of things you would change in your life and tackle that list with solutions, even if the solution seems impossible

"(OP: This advice may not be of use to you, now, as your lice are no longer in your hair - perhaps have eggs on your pillowcases etc?)

There is a nearly foolproof cure that works for killing all Headlice, and they eggs, in your hair - that is surprisingly unknown.

And, its cheap, chemical free (depending on your definition of chemicals), and it only takes a single attempt.  

Also, it even works on super curly hard-to-comb hair, and Dreadlocks also.

I've had to use this twice in my life, on myself and aprox 5 others each time. So sample set is only N=12, but it's had a 100% success rate for us (one girl had to repeat the process twice, for everyone else it worked on the first go).  I've done a quick internet search now, and if you looks at the results based on the substances alone, they say it wont work - but it's not the substances alone, its \_how\_ you use them.  Please share, more people should know.

You will need:

* Medicinal Alcohol (the strongest you can find, but not less than 70%, ideally 90+)
* Regular Conditioner (1 bottle)
* A plastic bag, like a small white trashbag.
* Some tape - packing tape will work.

Why is getting rid of Lice difficult? Because its not to hard to kill the living insects, but it's the eggs that hard to remove all off, and they hatch and the process starts again....

&#x200B;

Instructions:

1. Make a 50/50 mixture of Alcohol and Conditioner. How much you will need will depend, obviously, on how much hair you have. But you want a lot.  For very long thick hair, you might want an entire bottle of conditioner, and the same amount of Alcohol.  
(Note: It is possible we added Vinegar too, it has been so many years now I don't recall exactly - if I had lice now, I would try the 50/50, and if that didnt work then 33/33/33 - vinegar alcohol conditioner)
2. Absolutely cover your hair in this mixture. Lots. This will be messy. Protect your eyes. Best way is if you can lie down on your back, with your head on a deep plastic tray, and have a friend do it for you.
3. Take the plastic bag, and put all your hair (and head) in it, put it over your head, down to your hairline or halfway down your forehead, NOT OVER YOUR EYES obviously. [Something like this photo, approximately](https://www.alamy.com/local-residents-wearing-plastic-bags-on-heads-walk-in-a-rain-in-kunming-southwest-chinas-yunnan-province-march-28-2010-artificial-rainfall-moist-image263918621.html?imageid=8B12C248-5DA8-4097-9296-7A4AB38B04C7&p=856787&pn=1&searchId=1fa2745c6316fb14d774bb7788e42d68&searchtype=0)
4. Now, take the tape, and tape that bag on your head!  We are gonna kill them with Fumes, yes Fumes. Make sure the bag is down the back of your head as far as possible - you want as much of your hair in the bag as possible - not sandwiched between the tape and the bag.
5. Wait as long as your can, but about 20 minutes should cover it. Massage it around a little.
6. BE CAREFUL, you have alcohol in your hair. You dont want that running down into your eyes. Have a cloth ready to wipe your forehead if there are drips.

That's it, take it off, wash your hair, and all the lice AND the eggs should be dead. 

SAFETY REMINDER: Be careful with your Alcohol, your concentration may be flammable. DO NOT SMOKE OR SIT NEXT TO A HEATER IF YOU TRY THIS.

&#x200B;

Now, I'm not going to claim I know how it works. It works, that was the main thing.  So I'll only repeat what I was told (which may be inaccurate):

>""This works because lice breath through their belly, the conditioner gets in their makes breathing difficult. It's also extremely greasy (by design) so it stops them being able to run around, and find air pockets to hide in etc. Like pouring detergent on your kitchen floor.  The fumes from the alcohol, trapped in the plastic bag, will kill both them at the eggs""

&#x200B;

Note: I have no idea if this is medically safe, maybe a passing doctor reading this can comment.  But I can say, we have never had an issue: except the one time in Greece where their alcohol from the pharamacy was 99% IIRC.  We got a slightly drunk from the alcohol (not drinking it, just from skin absorption.  I have to say (and I'm not a drinker) it was just about the nicest ""mildly drunk"" I've ever had, because you didn't have all this poison (alcohol) in your belly, so it was a much ""cleaner"" feeling.

"When Hurricane Ian came through, the powerful winds and rain completely destroyed a shed on the side of my house. I’m at a complete loss, trying to figure out how I can get the area cleaned up.

A front-end loader or Bobcat and skip bin would be a simple solution. That could be 4k (+) with disposal fees, etc. 

Slightly cheaper option is getting a skip bin dropped off and hiring your own handyman to dismantle and fill it.

Or, better yet, find a local handyman/person with a good reputation and ask them to guide you. They can order the bin to size once they see the area in person. Let them dismantle it and load it. That could save you waiting, as machinery will be very popular right now. Still an expensive job, but you will get what you pay for. I couldn't imagine that being less than 2.5k (AUD).

"Most important thing to know--most car salesmen want you to leave with a new or used car that day and they'll pull all kinds of antics in an effort to make that happen.

They are going to want to price the car with financing and trade-in.  Don't let them do that, get the price, then negotiate the trade-in and financing separately.  If their loan is better than your bank's or credit union's so be it.  It probably won't be, especially if you belong to a credit union.

If possible, go with a friend and have the friend drive--that's the easiest way to deflect the effort to price with trade-in--""Sorry, that's my friend's car, not the one I will be trading"".  If the friend is knowledgeable about cars so much the better.

Learn to say ""no"".

If the salesman says ""I need to go talk to my manager"" that's your cue to leave.

That said, have fun.  It's shopping, just like shopping for new clothes or any other product.  The salesman's job is to convince you that the car he has is the one you want, your job is to decide whether you agree with him.

Take your car seat, try it out in anything that looks like a good candidate.  Take your heaviest winter coat and get in and out with that coat on--I've found that I can quickly rule out a number of models because I just plain can't get into them easily with a heavy coat on.  Do test drives if offered.

Make up a list of must-haves, and a list of nice-to-haves, and a list of no-nevers--stuff that you really *don't* want, and check everything you look at against your list.

"Hang in there friend.  It's a tough road.  I don't know that I have advice but I can share some of my story.  
I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder and have dealt with some of the social anxiety issues you describe for several decades.  
  
- I'm in therapy, in a support group, and Itake meds, I've had a lot of shame about that in the past, but I'm learning there's nothing to be ashamed of, and to be proud of how I'm healing.  
  
- Meditation has helped a lot.  Specifically exercising a practice of picturing a small part of myself as a sort of external observer.  Just observing my anxiety noting how it feels, how it changes my breathing, what muscles get tight, the nonsensical spiraling thoughts and on and on.  This little part of me doesn't doesn't judge anything, doesn't fight anything, it just observes and accepts me as is.  And I'm honestly not sure how, but this is somehow very freeing.
  
- I talk to my anxiety as if it's a person (only out loud of I'm by myself, lol),  in an accepting and caring way.  ""Hey anxiety, you do such a good job of watching my back for dangerous things.  I am so grateful.  But hey buddy, if you want, you can take a little break right now, you must be tired from working so hard to protect me.  And I think this conversation is safe enough that I'm a handle it on my own.  
  
- I treat socializing as a skill i have to practice.  Some people train for marathons. I train to talk to people.  I need discipline and lots of practice.  I need rest days.  I have set backs, but I learn from them.  I don't throw my self straight into a marathon, I work up with smaller workouts.   It's never something that comes naturally, but I can get better at it a little bit at a time.
  
  
All I've recognized that I cannot beat my anxiety by fighting it.  It comes from a part of myself that is broken and in desperate need of tender care.  The more care and love I give that part myself, the easier it is to live with and work with.  Again, I've been at this for decades and I'm still figuring it out one day at a time.

It’s okay to let past friendships go if they’re not putting energy into it or meeting you in the middle.

Look for clubs or hobbies that give you structured activities. Sports if you’re into them, social dance, robotics, stuff outside school. This gives you an activity to focus on and take the pressure off organic social interaction so it may come a bit more naturally.

"I am so sorry about you dog. What a horrible loss. I lived in Texas where Fire Ants are a big issue with pets and livestock. They come inside when the weather is extremely hot and dry. 

Fire Ants need more than just the home remedies. Orthene by Ortho works. Amdro works better (IMO) However, it may not be available in your area (Amdro can’t be bought or sold in Colorado where I currently live). Both work best when applied dry to the mounds and to the ant trail. They take it back to the queen and when it kills her the rest of the nest will die. These products are toxic to dogs and cats so read the label carefully prior to application. 

With the hot summer we have had, it may take several applications to get rid of the ants. 

Since you have had such a devastating infestation and you have other pets to consider, you may want to contact a professional to help get the situation under control. 

If you are stung by a Fire Ant in the future, here is a home remedy that can help. If you can apply a drop of bleach (like liquid Clorox) to the sight within 10 minutes of being stung, it can keep the bite from itching so bad and creating a painful blister. I am not a doctor, so don’t do this if you are allergic or if you get multiple stings. We use a cotton bud or a paper towel and dab the bleach on the bite and let it dry. Watch the bite for extreme redness and/or swelling. My son is allergic to Fire Ant bites and has a bigger reaction. Seek medical attention if you have a reaction or it happens with a child or pet.

Have her make a college list, including safe/easy to get into schools, regular schools, and 'stretch' schools. She should look at college rankings, subjects she likes, interest groups, school size, housing options, etc. City/rural/in between? On/off campus living? Tiny school where you know everyone, middle sized, or large where you can blend into the crowd easily? Close to home, far or in-between?

Research: Costs, typical financial aid packages offered, and other costs (room, meal plans, books, etc.) and figure out price ranges you can work with

Look up the schools' entrance requirements and early application process (and waitlist processes)

Visit the schools, talk to students and professors. You'll be surprised how many people are willing to give a little honest spiel about their school

Check out the schools' ""On Time Graduation Rates"" and average class room sizes (general AND for freshmen). Also check out covid practices and impacts to cost/housing/etc. Maybe save that covid piece for when your kids narrowed down to 5 or less 

For actually applying, grades and essays are most important. Look up 2 dozen example essays and read them. Understand what makes some good. References are also huge (if required). Get someone who is capable of expanding on how your kid is unique and a good fit for a diverse set of people.

I believe a lot of schools no longer require SAT/ACT or SATIIs. If your kid's target schools do, then she should be practicing now. The test prep classes are more about forcing you to practice this strange long test and getting used to it rather than teaching something new. The college board has multiple studies that show if you practice more and spend on test prep, you do better. I'd recommend buying (or renting) test prep books and getting cracking on the weekends.

Get ready for rejection. The top schools HAVE to reject awesome students. There are millions of fantastic students around the world, at some point it's a literal coin flip to choose.

Get ready for excitement.

I have found that guidance counselors are a very  mixed bag. Some are super hands on about college apps and some are simply too busy to provide more than general advice.

If you are not comfortable taking off the cover of your panel and replacing breakers I highly recommend getting an electrician - on this front: get a new fan and call in a service call to fix the fan, the electrician if they are decent should be able to fix the old one when they take it down, if they can't you have a new fan to put up.
