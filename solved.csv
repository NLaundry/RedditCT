"I've been using these for 30 years. 20 years of that was enduring bitter or burnt, rubbery tasting coffee (from letting it sit gurgling and hissing away on the stovetop too long) and occasionally, a mysteriously really good brew. Then, 10 years ago, I cracked it!

My tip is to only let about 2-3 centimetres come through - when you get a bit of crema appearing. 

Quickly get it off the stove and run cold water over the bottom section to cool it down and stop any more coming through. This way you only get the good stuff and avoid the bitter tail. 

Now you'll have quite a thick brew that needs water added to it. I find an equal measure of water to coffee is the best ratio. I use a cocktail jigger to do this for each cup - 1 part coffee to 1 part water.  

Top it up with hot milk (or water) You can make a really excellent cup of coffee this way.

Also, using filtered or even distilled (demineralised) water in the pot can make a big flavour improvement.

I will also make a few brews and funnel it all into a bottle through a paper coffee filter to strain out any grounds that can also add bitterness. You can then keep your brew in the fridge for iced coffees or your morning hot coffee.

Edit: I should say, I have a 6 cup pot - smaller pots may require an earlier cut off point. Try to get it under the cold water tap before it really starts hissing and spitting through - it's bitter-coffee town once that happens as far as I'm concerned.",Monkbrown,False,24,322,2,12,ysamt2

"Yes. It will involve finding a driver (hardware, not software) for the infotainment screen, and a way to intercept the signal going to the screen on the seat camera in a protocol that the infotainment screen driver accepts. You'll also need to get the existing infotainment screen signal, and you'll need to modify its proportions to fit the carseat camera. If you're a very skilled engineer, and more than a little lucky, you'll be able to do all this in about 6 months to 1 year.

An alternative is to look for a way to sideload apps into your infotainment system, then write software that displays a streamed video, then replace the carseat camera with something that streams h254  or something similar. This will take a little more luck, but the engineering effort is lower. Excluding the time spent looking for the sideload, you can do this in about a week. Maybe even a day or two if you've done this kind of streaming before.

So, the short answer is: no. No, there is not a way to do this.

edit: actually, yes, there is a very easy way to do this if you're willing to void your warranty. Take the wires going to one of your external camera. Get a new external camera module. Mount it where it can see your carseat. Rewire to that camera.
